# Link Shortener

Welcome to my Link Shortener tool, a convenient web application that I designed to help students at Indiana University shorten long and cumbersome URLs into concise and easy-to-share links. This service is perfect for simplifying links for class projects, social media, or any online activity where you want to make your URLs more user-friendly.

If you enjoyed the talk I gave over the architecture and design of making such a system, don't be afraid to check out the source code to find out more about how everything works!

## Features

- **Easy Link Shortening:** Quickly transform long URLs into shorter, more manageable links.
- **Customizable Short Links:** Create custom aliases for your links to make them even more memorable.
- **Tracking and Analytics:** Keep track of link usage and analytics to see how often your links are clicked.
- **Password Protection:** Optionally secure your links with passwords to restrict access.
- **Expiration Dates:** Set expiration dates for your links to automatically deactivate them after a certain period.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Our user-friendly web interface makes link management a breeze.

## Getting Started

To start using the IU Link Shortener, follow these steps:

1. Visit the link shortening service at [go.iu.run](https://go.iu.run) (Please note that the service may not be live yet, but it will be soon).

2. [WIP] Sign in using your Indiana University credentials. IU has been very weird about 3rd party SSO/OIDC, so I'm still looking for ways to mediate this; there's no reason it should only be for IU students though...

3. Once logged in, you can start shortening links by pasting the long URL into the provided field.

4. Customize your link alias (optional), set password protection and expiration date (if needed), and click the "Shorten" button.

5. Your shortened link will be generated and ready to use!

## Usage Guidelines

- Please do not use this service for malicious or illegal purposes.
- Respect copyright and intellectual property rights when sharing links.
- Use password protection and expiration dates responsibly.
